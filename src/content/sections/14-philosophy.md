## Philosophical Foundation

These principles are informed by Frederic Bastiat's _The Law_ (1850), which argues that a system designed for a narrow, legitimate purpose remains healthy, while a system that accumulates scope beyond its mandate becomes the source of the dysfunction it was meant to prevent. The sole legitimate purpose of law is to protect life, liberty, and property — when extended beyond that purpose, it becomes an instrument of plunder rather than justice.

Applied here: a capability that exceeds its bounded purpose becomes the source of the bugs, coupling, and fragility it was meant to prevent. A binary that tries to do everything does nothing well. An agent that owns too much context becomes a bottleneck rather than an accelerator. Restraint in scope is the foundation of a system that actually works.

This matters now because we are in a paradigm shift as significant as any before it. The personal computer made the individual productive. The internet made communication free. The cloud made infrastructure code. Agentic AI makes capability composition the fundamental unit of work — and MCP is the protocol that standardizes it the way HTTP standardized the internet era. The principles in this document are designed for this new reality: systems built from small, honest, self-describing capabilities that humans and agents compose with confidence because every piece declares what it does, what it risks, and how to watch it.
