## Deployment

### 34. DevX Informs Deploy

The DevX informs deploy. Deploy must be all in code and where the human is needed, the single command to satisfaction that is a chain of scripts applies too. Laptop to production is one command. The deploy script syncs code, builds images, imports them, injects secrets, applies manifests, restarts services, and verifies — all logged, all idempotent, all in the repo.
